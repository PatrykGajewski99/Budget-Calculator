Hello everyone. Budget Calculator is an application which was created step by step using Bootstrap, PHP and Laravel framework. This app is very usefull for people who want have control of their budget and have all expenses in one place.
I wrote a description below, of how to start this application.

1.Run xampp

2.You should create "budget_calculator" database in PHPMyAdmin

3.Upload this .sql code -> [budget_calculator.zip](https://github.com/PatrykGajewski99/Budget-Calculator-LARAVEL/files/9032950/budget_calculator.zip)

4.Open the project in PhpStorm / Visual Studio Code etc

5.Write in terminal this command "php artisan serv"

6.If you wanna look for admin functions you can change the privilege in the database "users" => "admin". In the next step, you have to log out and log in again.

I will be very grateful for every suggestion about my code. Thank you in advance. If you wanna read more about my application , I put here my portfolio -> https://pgajewski.pl/
